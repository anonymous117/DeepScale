This repository provides additional materials to our paper to simplify the reproducability of results. It also containes further evaluation results that could not be shown in the paper due to the lack of space. The repository contains the following things:

* The benchmark codes used in the paper
* The scripts and code used for analysis, evaluation, and visualization
* Extended results of the evaluation and case study
* A modified version of Extra-P that was used to create the performance models
